ToDo API.

### Considerations

**Why Nest.js?**

Usually I'd consider using a framework like Nest.js an overkill for a coding challenge, but taking into account the requirement that this code base should be build to scale to a team of 10 or more engineers I decided to use a framework. Every small codebase that is created by a start up will eventually morph into a badly documented, badly maintained and badly tested framework itself. So why not strat with one that is well documented, maintained and tested.
